# Drive Cage Management and Physical Disk Management

There are two types of drive enclosures that are used for expansion:
HPE 3PAR StoreServ Storage SFF 2.5-inch Drive Enclosure
HPE 3PAR StoreServ Storage LFF 3.5-inch Drive Enclosure

The number of drive enclosures attached to a specific controller node pair should be determined by the desired RAID set size and HA Cage protection requirements. Drive enclosures should be added and configured to meet the HA Cage protection requirement for a specific controller node pair, and also consider the RAID set requirement of the customer.
